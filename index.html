					Experienced full-stack product engineer adept at architecting and implementing features for web applications at cloud scale

					Currently serving as an Area Tech Lead overseeing three cross-functional teams comprising over 20 engineers within the Growth Engineering group at Dropbox.
					Instrumental in driving top-of-funnel traffic growth, my team and I have achieved significant milestones:

					<ul>
						<li>
							Spearheaded the delivery of pivotal projects and foundational components, culminating in a noteworthy 20% Year-over-Year increase in signups
						</li>
						<li>
							Executed multiple high-impact experiments aimed at exposing extensive segments of the in-product experience to logged-out users, resulting in a 4x increase in conversion likelihood
						</li>
						<li>
							Took the lead in organizational-wide initiatives focused on reliability enhancement and web performance optimization, leading to heightened uptime and increased page engagement across the entire platform
						</li>
						<li>
							Engineered a hybrid headless Content Management System (CMS) empowering marketing and product teams at Dropbox to swiftly craft high-performance landing pages.
							This system incorporates zero-code experimentation capabilities, robust personalization features, and seamless internationalization support
						</li>
					</ul>

					In my previous life at VMware, I served as an UI lead for several networking/security products and features including the firewall suite
					in NSX-T. Led design, development and maintenance of the core pieces of firewall infrastructure with special focus on scalability, usability
					and interactive visualization tools. Helped transition the team from the legacy ExtJS framework to Angular 2 through 5 including the
					adoption of redux patterns for state management. Several of my hackathon projects at VMWare were either shaped into product features or turned
					into tools to drive <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gr2dwah" target="_blank">VMWorld keynote presentations</a>

					Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication - this is one of the design philosophies that I have come to embrace. Of course,
					building cloud-scale enterprise apps that actually require one to get a certification even before they can go past
					the login screen, based on the above mantra is no child's play. It's akin to building a ballistic missile that's fit
					for use by a seven year old. No one has done anything like this and no one in their right minds honestly wants to. And
					oftentimes it's unique predicaments such as this that lead to design and engineering marvel.</p>

				<h2>WARP - DBX Website Rearchitecture Program</h2>
				<p>
					Through WARP I am helping re-architect the logged out experience on dropbox.com by enabling critical platform capabilities
					like content management, experimentation, design systems and data pipelines in a hybrid tech stack that combines DBX's
					core tech stack and CMS solutions like AEM.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Firewall UI Framework</h2>
				<p>
					Created a REDUX based component framework to create firewall-esque grids at lightning speed with baked-in functionality
					like infinite scroll, inline-edit, multi-valued filter, drag/drop, global at-scale publish. The framework is currently
					used to serve 5 different flavors of firewall in the current version of NSX.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Policy for NSX</h2>
				<p>
					Policy for NSX is an overarching component that facilitates policy templating for workloads in the NSX context. I am currently
					leading the UI initiative to develop an abstract presentation language for policy workflows in NSX. The draft (constructed
					with JSON) is designed to be rich in features like layout specification, input validation, dynamic data querying and
					conditional logic to hide/show sections based on user input.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>NSX TimeMachine</h2>
				<p>
					Developed a media player-esque interactive UI, that lets users pause, play, rewind and restore the complete state of their
					logical network in an AR-enabled application. Technologies used: AngularJS, D3JS, Wikitude AR Toolkit.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Autopology</h2>
				<p>
					Built during Borathon 2015 and winner of the "Judge's choice award", Autopology is a web app to design a logical network
					at scale using visual cues in a drag-drop-describe workflow. Using a combination of smart defaults and custom input,
					the tool translates a visual schematic into logical entities on the NSX manager doing all the heavy lifting behind the
					scenes.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Jarvis</h2>
				<p>
					Developed an internal web-based tool as a part of a two member team that allows deployment of pre-provisioned network topologies
					and perform runtime monitoring of deployed assets in a production cloud. Apart from helping devs to run pre-commit tests,
					Jarvis helps PMs/SEs deploy SDDC stacks at the click of a button. I have contributed to the project as a full-stack
					developer owing to my familarity with the LAMP stack. One of my recent contributions to project is the ability to add
					private topologies.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>TribeBuilder</h2>
				<p>
					Built overnight as a part of the NSBU Jamz Hackathon and winner of the "Voice of audience award", TribeBuilder allows users
					to deploy large scale (>5k nodes) at the click of a button. Built with D3, the UI uses an interactive zoom-able canvas
					to draw network elements in a graphical layout.

					The only thing better than a travel book (or show) is going there yourself. As a kid I remember watching Nat Geo with awe
					every time I got in front of the TV. So as an adult, when I finally got the means and opportunity to travel, I have
					always tried to say YES!
